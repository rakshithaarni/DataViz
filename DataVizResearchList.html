			<!-- The summary for the first article begins -->
			<div>  <br>This article published on South China Morning Post on September 2015 draws parallels between the current refugee crisis in Europe and the Vietnamese refugee crisis of the late 1970s. It talks about the specific challenges that were faced during the continual influx of Vietnamese refugees fleeing the Communist regime in 1970s to Hong Kong, and explains the daunting policy changes that impacted Hong Kong’s polity and economy. By looking at past experiences, the article calls on the international community to learn from Hong Kong’s “humane” handling of the refugee crisis, and draw well-crafted policy decisions to not repeat the mistakes of the  past.

			<div> <br> This research paper addresses the volatile relationship between Vietnam and China as Vietnamese refugees poured into the shores of China during 1975. From being understanding of the political turmoil in Vietnam, the paper talks about how the feelings of Vietnam’s South-East neighbors changed drastically to “incredulity, indignation, and then hostility” as the crisis hardened. It also brings to fore the harbored anxieties of the host country receiving vast groups of people into their country. For example, China felt that Vietnamese refugees were a political instrument used by the South Vietnam government as a vendetta against China under the USSR. The paper also provides a comprehensive view of the perception of the Chinese Vietnamese in Vietnam and the political and economic ramifications of the growing mistrust both within and outside Vietnam that worsened the refugee crisis.

				<br> This article, published in South China Morning Post on 14 September 2015 documents the journey of a Vietnamese refugee in Hong Kong, who fled her country as a 10-year old. It traces her life trying to make amends in a new homeland, the article touches on the emotional and physical turmoil that refugees are subject to, even when they escape conflict from their homeland. It touches on the issues of repatriation and whether that becomes a viable solution in the eyes of someone who has a lived experience as a refugee, and whether local integration is a possibility in such cases.

				<br> This report, by the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) published in 1996 highlights the successes of one of the refugee settlement plans in South East Asia. It lauds the implementation of the Comprehensive Plan of Action for having effectively repatriated the “boat people of Vietnam”, or Vietnamese who fled their countries as refugees during the late 1970s. IT also provides a comprehensive view of the shortcomings of UNHCR’s efforts in the Vietnamese refugee camps in Hong Kong, and highlights the challenges of repatriation, both forced and voluntary.
